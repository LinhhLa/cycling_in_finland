HSL provides bike services for Helsinki and Espoo, but the services are still limited. The goal of this analysis is to examine the pattern of bikes usage in Helsinki and Espoo and recommend which regions HSL should build more bike stations.

**Preliminary assumptions:**
* Area-specific population is correlated with total cycling distance and total cycling duration.
* Age group is correlated with geographical population distribution. Thus, younger people live near the center than older people.

**Theoretical knowledge:**
* Hypothesis is tested using linear regression coefficient score.
* The linear regression coefficients describe the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
* Linear regression coefficient score is range from -1 to 1.

**Findings:**
* The highest total cycling distance is found in the 'Keskinen suurpiiri - Central,' 'Eteläinen suurpiiri-Southern,' and 'Läntinen suurpiiri-Western' districts of Helsinki. Remarkably, these areas also boast the highest population density in the city.
* Conversely, cycling distances are notably low in the 'Koillinen suurpiiri-Northeastern' and 'Itäinen suurpiiri-Eastern' districts, despite their relatively high population densities.
* Likewise, the greatest cycling distances in Espoo are recorded in Tapiola, Leppävaara, and Matinkylä. Remarkably, these locales also harbor the highest population densities in Espoo.
* Areas like Vanha and Espoonlahti exhibit relatively high population densities yet lack cycling stations. This suggests that HSL has yet to fully realize the potential of cycling infrastructure expansion.
* There is a proportional relationship between total distance and total duration by area. The young tend to live near the city centre while the elderly tend to live on the outskirts.
 Age group is correlated with geographical population distribution.
